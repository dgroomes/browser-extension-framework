// I think there is a defect in the Deno Intellij plugin because I had to rename this file from 'deno.jsonc' to 'deno.json'
// so Intellij would recognize the `"lib": ["dom", ...` option. Without this change, I got IDE red underline highlights
// saying "Deno can't find 'document'. Add `"lib": "dom"` to your deno.json file".

    // The "lib" configuration helps us write browser-compatible JavaScript code. This means our TypeScript code will
    // be verified against browser types like "Document".

    // While converting from JavaScript to TypeScript we can benefit from relaxing the type strictness. If the conversion
    // from JavaScript to TypeScript is not coupled with any refactoring, then we can lean on the existing code because
    // it's working code. If we were to restructure and refactor while converting from JavaScript to TypeScript, that's
    // a different proposition. The new code hasn't been tested/used yet and would benefit from the type strictness.
